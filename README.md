> ABOUT US::

nitnem4all group was born from humble beginnings. The idea for a virtual platform for the Sikh community initially evolved from visits to the local Gurudwaras. There was a strong need to keep the community bind with gurbani and nitnem. The idea then evolved in to creating a virtual platform for the Sikh community, where nitnem could be accessed and shared from a single location.

Today, nitnem4all is the biggest virtual platform for the Sikh community in solapur and aims to bridge the information gap for the older members of the community by keeping them connected with gurbani even in these times without leaving their homes. The platform also benefits and supports the younger generation by teaching them the concept of spiritual values and working towards a better and more sustainable world. Community work and helping the disadvantaged is a very important aspect of nitnem4all group.Imagine if everyone in the world did an act of kindness or performed one good deed per day. This planet, our home, would be a much better place to live in.

The team at nitnem4all appreciates your ongoing support and feedback as we continue to grow and support the community.

> WHAT IS NITNEM ??

Nitnem Path is a collection of Sikh hymns (Gurbani) to be read minimally 3 different times of the day. These are mandatory and to be read by every Amritdhari Sikh as expressed in the Sikh Rehat Maryada. Optionally additional prayers may be added to a Sikh’s nitnem. There are five hymns (Five Banis) to be done during Amrit Vela (early morning), the Rehras Sahib hymn for the evening and Kirtan Sohila for the night, The morning and evening prayers should be followed by an Ardaas.

Nitnem banis are the daily prayers of Sikhism. Five required daily prayers are known as panj bania. The Sikhism prayerbook is called a gutka, is treated with special respect because the daily prayers of Sikhsim are taken from the holy scripture Guru Granth Sahib and the compositions of Tenth Guru Gobind Singh. The prayers of Sikhism are written in the Gurmukhi script, the sacred language of Gurbani used only for Sikh prayers. Every Sikh is expected to learn Gurmukhi and read, recite, or listen to the required daily prayers which make up the Nitnem banis.

There are 7 banis in nitnem which need to be compulsorily recited by a sikh every day..
they are divided into 3 groups based on the time they need to be recited::

## 1) AMRIT VELE DI BAANI --- these banis is recited at the early morning hours after a sikh wakes up and bathes.. They include::
   
   == [JAPJI SAHIB](https://nitnem4all.github.io/Gjapji%20sahib.htm)
   == [JAAP SAHIB](https://nitnem4all.github.io/Gjaap%20sahib.htm)
   == [TVA PRASAD SAVAIYE](https://nitnem4all.github.io/Gtva%20prasad%20saviyay.htm)
   == [CHOUPAI SAHIB](https://nitnem4all.github.io/Gchoupai%20sahib.htm)
   == [ANAND SAHIB](https://nitnem4all.github.io/Ganand%20sahib.htm)
   
## 2) SANDHYA VELE DI BAANI --- this bani is recited at the time when the sun is going down::

## 3) RAAT VICH SON DE VELE PADHAN DI BAANI --- this bani is on your bed when your going for sleep::
